# Anime Jupyter Notebook Repo

I thought it would be fun to use python to process and play with anime data.

I will not include csv the files in this repo, because I don't want to configure git lfs.

All CSV files can be found here: [MyAnimeList Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist).

Download the archive and extract the files into the data folder
